# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio website repo! On my portfolio website you will find information about me, my skills and the projects I've worked on.This is an ongoing project. The website has a responsive design to mobile, tablet, and laptop desktop screen sizes.

The purpose of this portfolio website is to present my projects and skills to potential employers and collaborators and to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, SCSS and Git.
